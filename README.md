# apple-page

This project consists of building a webpage using images as a background and adding gradients to elements. The goal is to make a clone of old an old version of the Apple website webpage.

In this project you’ll clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It’s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that you should be able to mimic.
